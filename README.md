# Welcome to my GitHub profile!
## About me
I don't do a lot of important work outside of my own hobbies, and most of my repositories are not interesting or useful in their current state.

My talent really shines with my understanding of the intricacies of the English language and my ability to comprehend complicated words easily.

Code of Conduct documents are the bane of my existence. When you're communicating with me, expect that I will follow the rules set out at https://nocodeofconduct.com/; I expect that you will too.
## About working with me on GitHub
I will often come to a random GitHub repository, report a bug or fix a typo (usually the latter) and then disappear somewhere else. My outside work is almost entirely non-committal (literal meaning, not as in `git` commits).

I am often excessively frank in my communications and appear more rude than I usually intend to.

My friends sometimes describe me as a realistic person, and I don't entirely disagree.

I have done minor outside work for a variety of notable projects, including but not limited to:
- Canonical
- HandBrake
- TurboWarp
- Ocular
- Yacy
- Pencil2D
- EasyList

Projects that I work on include:
- MiniGuinea (an adblocker with none of the nonsense, along with a permissive MIT-style license agreement)
- homemade_yes (the GNU `yes` command but slightly faster on some machines; written in ~30 lines of Rust)
- yes_installer (a script to quickly install and manage a copy of homemade_yes)
- Jameson (a programming language for people who liked Scratch before it started paywalling stuff)
- https://mojavesoft.net and its mirror site https://mojavesoft.org (website for cool people)
## About mixing code and politics in my presence
Code is code, politics are politics. If you want to express your own politics, go buy a web server.

X11, X11Libre, Wayland, and GNOME have all recently violated this rule in the last 6 months.

## X11 or Wayland?
My daily driver runs Wayland at the moment, but I really don't care about that choice. Both of them are maintained horribly (see above) and I would use something better if it were more convenient.

I think that the idea of sabotaging X11 in favor of Wayland is not a good one, but I'm stuck with two equally bad choices and Wayland was easier to set up on Ubuntu 25.04. Don't involve me in your petty wars and be grateful that someone cared to make the software (for zero cost) that profits you every single day, both financially and in a general sense.

## Views on cybersecurity
If someone uses a badly-constructed lock on their house, they probably left an open window somewhere.

Don't bother with the lock. See what you can do with the window.

If you're a software developer: build it and the bad actors will come.
